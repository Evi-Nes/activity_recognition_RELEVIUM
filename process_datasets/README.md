This folder contains the necessary data for training and test the models found in the train_models folder.
The final files used are the **train_data_9.csv** and **test_data_9.csv** files. If you want to recreate these files you need
to follow these steps:

- run all preprocess_*.py files to preprocess each dataset separately
- run files 01_combine_datasets, 02_train_test_split and 03_combine_9_classes to combine all the data files
